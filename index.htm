                {img:'image/New folder/portfolio/8.jpg',title:'dicrap',detail:'LILY LIKES TO PLAY WITH CRAYONS AND PENCILS',description:'The origin of Nature Day in Iran is rooted in Zoroastrianism. About 4,000 years ago, ‘Sidaz Be-dar’ was celebrated in ancient Iran to worship ‘Teshtar,’ the god of rain, in the hopes that the prayers offered that day would make the god overcome the drought demon and send in the rains. Over the past few centuries, the day has been stripped of its religious affiliations and is now seen more as a cultural holiday than a religious one.‘Sizdah Be-dar’ simply means “getting rid of the number 13.” In Iran, just as in many world cultures, the number 13 is feared as an ominous number. ‘Triskaidekaphobia’ is the scientific term for this fear. Iranians believe that by going out for picnics in places like parks and the countryside on the 13th day of the ‘Nowruz’ celebrations, they are discarding all their bad luck and would start the rest of the year on a good note. The last activity of the day’s celebration is generally believed to perform that task. At the end of the picnics, observers take green plant shoots grown from the beginning of the ‘Nowruz’ celebrations and release them on flowing water bodies, usually rivers or streams.Besides releasing green plant shoots on rivers, a version of the western ‘April Fool’ known as ‘Lie of the Thirteenth’ is observed on the day and typically involves playing pranks on others. Other fun activities marking the day include singing, dancing, chattering, playing games, and for the young singles, tying knots in the grass, hoping that doing so would bring them spouses — a practice that also has strong affiliations to an Iranian religious myth. Iranian foods like ‘Sekanjabin’ (a drink made from vinegar and honey) and ‘Ash-e Doogh’ (yogurt syrup) are generally consumed on this day.'},

This About Vintage chrono clearly takes style inspiration from this classic and it doesnt disappoint! It is substantial and comfortable on the wrist with solid and smooth movement (even for a quartz). Im very satisfied as always with the product from this brand. Ive been wearing everyday (signature stainless steel bracelet) for almost one month and have received several compliments from my watch-loving friends, who all ask about the brand.

Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where typists rest their wrist down, rather than lifting up and typing (which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome [citation needed]). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their feet flat on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.Many touch typists also use keyboard shortcuts when typing on a computer. This allows them to edit their document without having to take their hands off the keyboard to use a mouse. An example of a keyboard shortcut is pressing the Ctrl key plus the S key to save a document as they type, or the Ctrl key plus the Z key to undo a mistake. Other shortcuts are the Ctrl key plus the C to copy and the Ctrl key and the V key to paste, and the Ctrl key and the X key to cut. Many'},

A motel performs the same functions as a hotel but in a format designed for travelers using automobiles.Inns have existed since very ancient times to serve merchants and other travelers. In the Roman Empire hostelries called mansiones were situated along the Roman road system to accommodate travelers on government or commercial business. The commercial revival of the European Middle Ages stimulated a widespread growth of inns and hostels. Many of these were operated by monastic brotherhoods in order to guarantee haven for travelers in dangerous regions; a famous example is the hostel in the Great St. Bernard Pass in the Swiss Alps, which was founded in the 10th century by St. Bernard of Montjoux and is still operated by the community of Augustinian monks. In 13th-century China Marco Polo found an extensive system of relay houses in existence to provide lodgings for travelers and way stations for the Mongol postal service.'}
